# Data-Structures-Algorithms

These are the programs I have been assigned in the class CS227:
Data Structures & Algorithms at PCC.

Here is a list of the main focus of each program.

**Program 1:**
Mainly review from my previous course, C Programming. It got
us used to using pointers again.

**Program 2:**
More pointer practice.

**Program 3:**
This program introduced pointer arithmetic and moving through a
database using pointers. Using indexes was not allowed. It also
introduced us to allocating memory using malloc() and using a 
selection sort.

**Program 4**
This program introduced us to structs. This program was challenging
for many of us students. It involved adding data, re-arranging data,
changing the data, and finally printing it.

**Program 5**
This program introduced us to recursion. We had to sum all even numbers
in a range of two whole numbers using a recursive function and prints
the numbers it is adding or skipping to demonstrate the recursive
solution.

**Program 7**

We are doing this program out of order. In this program I created
three different searching algorithms to search arrays of integers.
The three algorithms were:
   Ordered Sequential Search
   Probability Search
   Binary Search
Once again there was a lot of printing to the terminal to demonstrate
the search paths and techniques of the algorithms.
