# Data-Structures-Algorithms

These are the programs I have been assigned in the class CS227:
Data Structures & Algorithms at PCC.

Here is a list of the main focus of each program.

**Program 1:**
Mainly review from my previous course, C Programming. It got
us used to using pointers again.

**Program 2:**
More pointer practice.

**Program 3:**
This program introduced pointer arithmetic and moving through a
database using pointers. Using indexes was not allowed. It also
introduced us to allocating memory using malloc() and using a 
selection sort.

**Program 4**
This program introduced us to structs. This program was challenging
for many of us students. It involved adding data, re-arranging data,
changing the data, and finally printing it.
